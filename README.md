# RemoveCookiesFirefox
Firefox Extension to Remove Cookies and Local Storage Cache by foooobar ( addon DOT support AT ya DOT ru )

This is a branch of https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-cookies-button-ver1x/ v1.3

Differences:
    - blue icon
    - we don't show a notification when the button is clicked, instead, we show the number of removed elements on the icon
    - we clean session storage as well
