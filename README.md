Firefox Extension to Remove Cookies, Local Storage and Session Storage by Marcos Diez (marcos AT unitron DOT com DOT br)

To install it on Firefox, go here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-cookies-button-md/

This is a branch of https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-cookies-button-ver1x/ v1.3 by  foooobar ( addon DOT support AT ya DOT ru )

Differences:
    - blue icon
    - we don't show a notification when the button is clicked, instead, we show the number of removed elements on the icon
    - we clean session storage as well
