# RemoveCookiesFirefox
Firefox Extension to Remove Cookies and Local Storage Cache by foooobar ( addon DOT support AT ya DOT ru )

This is a branch of https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-cookies-button-ver1x/ v1.3

The only difference is that it does not show browser messages every time cookies are cleaned.
Instead, the number of cookies removed is displayed in the tooltip.
Also, the icon is painted blue :)
